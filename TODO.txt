TO DO:

- add custom logger instead of modifying the root logger
- add match on source (only when this is provided by subliminal)


TO CHECK:
- check if we need to request our own TVDB API key (and perhaps use an API CALL CHECK for it to prevent excessive usage)
- check if Cheetah and setuptools must be added to requirements in readme.md
- check if the used libraries can be put in our own lib folder so an install with setup.py is not longer needed
